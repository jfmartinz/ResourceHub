# Compiler Design

Compiler design involves the creation of programs that translate high-level code written by programmers into machine code that can be executed by a computer's hardware. This field is fundamental in computer science and involves several stages including lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation. The study and implementation of compilers help in understanding the intricacies of programming languages and the efficient execution of programs.
