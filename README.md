After making your changes, you need to stage the changes for commit using the `git add` command. To stage all changes, use:

```bash
git add .
```

#### Commit Your Changes:

Commit your staged changes with a descriptive commit message that explains the purpose of your changes. Use the `git commit` command:

```bash
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"
```

> Note: Replace "Your descriptive commit message here" with a concise and informative message.
