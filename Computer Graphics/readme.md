# Computer Graphics

Computer graphics refers to the imathat are generated using a computer. This can include 2D images, such as photos or illustrations, as well as 3D images, which are generated using specialized software and require more processing power. Computer graphics are used in a wide range of applications, including video games, animation, architecture, engineering, and medical imaging. Advances in computer technology have made it possible to create increasingly realistic and detailed graphics, and the use of computer graphics continues to grow and evolve.
