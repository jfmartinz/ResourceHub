<h2>how to obtain github api key from github--></h2>

<h3> 1) Log in to GitHub: Go to the GitHub website and log in with your account.</h3>

<h3> 2) Access Token Settings:</h3>
Click on your profile picture in the top right corner.
Select Settings from the dropdown menu.
In the left sidebar, click on Developer settings.
Then, click on Personal access tokens.

<h3> 3) Generate New Token:</h3>
Click on the Generate new token button.
Give your token a descriptive name in the Note field.
Select the scopes or permissions you’d like to grant this token. Scopes determine what access the token has, so be sure to select only the permissions necessary for your use case.

<h3> 4) Set Expiration:</h3>
Choose an expiration date for your token. It’s a good security practice to set an expiration date that’s not too far in the future.

<h3> 5) Generate Token:</h3>
Once you’ve configured the settings, click the Generate token button at the bottom of the page.

<h3> Copy Your New Token:</h3>
After the token is generated, make sure to copy it and store it in a secure place. You won’t be able to see it again once you navigate away from the page.
