# Data Structures and Algorithm (DSA)

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) refer to the study of methods for organizing and storing data and the design of procedures (algorithms) for solving problems, which operate on these data structures. 

DSA is one of the most important skills that every computer science student must have. It is often seen that people with good knowledge of these technologies are better programmers than others and thus, crack the interviews of almost every tech giant.

This section serves as a curated collection of valuable resources for learning and mastering DSA, catering to beginners and experienced developers alike.

## Types of Data Structures

> Here comes the most crucial and the most awaited stage of the roadmap for learning data structure and algorithm – the stage where you start learning about DSA.

<table width="100%" id="data-structures-and-algorithm">
  <tr>
    <th>Data Structure</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><a href="https://youtu.be/eXFItikqw8c?si=XiKITpwy75hvMxlX"> Array </a></td>
  <td> The most basic yet important data structure is the array. It is a linear data structure. An array is a collection of homogeneous data types where the elements are allocated contiguous memory. Because of the contiguous allocation of memory, any element of an array can be accessed in constant time. Each array element has a corresponding index number. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><a href="https://youtu.be/kjU04wGSYzw?si=PWGeFw0oSiNoHlSN"> Strings </a></td>
  <td> A string is a sequence of characters. It is a linear data structure. A string is also a type of array. It can be interpreted as an array of characters. But it has some special characteristics like the last character of a string is a null character to denote the end of the string. Also, there are some unique operations, like concatenation which concatenates two strings into one. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><a href="https://youtu.be/58YbpRDc4yw?si=SCnvN0m2S_PFMy6K"> Linked List </a></td>
  <td> As the above data structures, the linked list is also a linear data structure. But Linked List is different from Array in its configuration. It is not allocated to contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node of the linked list is allocated to some random memory space and the previous node maintains a pointer that points to this node. So no direct memory access of any node is possible and it is also dynamic i.e., the size of the linked list can be adjusted at any time. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><a href="https://youtu.be/bxRVz8zklWM?si=yE2xewYRFknmumAY"> Stack </a></td>
  <td> Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out). The reason why Stack is considered a complex data structure is that it uses other data structures for implementation, such as Arrays, Linked lists, etc. based on the characteristics and features of Stack data structure.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><a href="https://youtu.be/W7uB9-TKfTg?si=zGRWmWUH11IxB3Zv"> Queue </a></td>
  <td> A Queue is a linear structure which follows First In First Out (FIFO) approach in its individual operations. Another data structure that is similar to Stack, yet different in its characteristics </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkIpj7mL1E7uSElwIoJpgBnOQ8RJrYKzX&si=VAOW04OMQ_sXhhNL"> Trees </a></td>
  <td> The first non-linear data structure you should learn is the tree. Tree data structure is similar to a tree we see in nature but it is upside down. It also has a root and leaves. The root is the first node of the tree and the leaves are the ones at the bottom-most level. The special characteristic of a tree is that there is only one path to go from any of its nodes to any other node.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td><a href="https://youtu.be/bvWVs0tJUOY?si=49dbm82Ck8_V2E70"> Graph </a></td>
  <td> A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges that connect a pair of nodes. Another important non-linear data structure is the graph. It is similar to the Tree data structure, with the difference that there is no particular root or leaf node, and it can be traversed in any order. </td>

##  Conclusion

 It is relatively easy to learn new programming languages while using them in projects. However, it is not the case with DSA as it needs extensive practice and holds utmost importance. If you are not well versed with DSA, you will find it challenging to optimize the code solution for a problem.

 All the best to all techies out here, preparing to fulfill their dream to get placed in their dream company and make their families happy.
