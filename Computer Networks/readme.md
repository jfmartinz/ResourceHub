# Computer Networks

A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices that can communicate with each other and share resources. These devices, known as nodes, can include computers, servers, networking hardware, and other peripherals. The purpose of a computer network is to enable devices to exchange data and resources efficiently and securely.

This functionality is incorporated to relate more with real life situation, e.g Tv/radio sends data even though there is no receiver connected.Whenever receiver connects to a particular station, it starts receiving live-streaming videos from that station. Receiver can pause, resume, change station or even terminate at any given time from GUI using thread.</td>

## Conclusion

Computer Networks are the backbone of modern communication, enabling seamless data exchange and connectivity across various devices and systems. With the advent of technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), 5G, and cloud computing, the importance of robust and efficient network infrastructures has grown exponentially. The diverse range of network types, including Local Area Networks (LANs), Wide Area Networks (WANs), and Wireless Networks, cater to different connectivity needs and scales. Advanced networking features and protocols, such as IP addressing, routing, and network security measures, empower administrators to manage and secure networks effectively. The networking community is vibrant and supportive, offering numerous resources such as tutorials, forums, and documentation to help both novices and seasoned professionals. To excel in computer networking, practical experience is essential—engage in hands-on labs, participate in networking challenges, and contribute to open-source projects. This practical approach not only enhances your understanding of networking concepts but also opens up exciting career opportunities in network administration, network engineering, and beyond.

Stay curious and keep networking!
