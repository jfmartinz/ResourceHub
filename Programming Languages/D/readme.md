# D Programming Language

D is a general-purpose programming language designed with systems programming in mind. It combines efficiency and control of systems programming languages like C and C++ with the expressiveness and convenience of modern scripting languages like Python and Ruby. Developed by Walter Bright at Digital Mars and released in 2001, D offers a unique blend of powerful features, strong performance, and ease of use.
