# Dart

Dart is an open-source general-purpose programming language developed by Google. It supports application development on both the client and server side. However, it is widely used for the development of Android apps, iOS apps, IoT(Internet of Things), and web applications using the Flutter Framework.

Syntactically, Dart bears a strong resemblance to Java, C, and JavaScript.  It is a dynamic object-oriented language with closure and lexical scope. The Dart language was released in 2011 but came into popularity after 2015 with Dart 2.0.
